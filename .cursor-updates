- Removed all edit inventory item logic and UI from InventoryDashboard and InventoryGrid. Editing is now only possible via the dedicated part detail page. 
- Refactored AdvancedPartForm to match AssetForm design and UX: react-hook-form, Card sections, selects, uploads, barcode generator, and consistent UI. 
- AdvancedPartForm now actually creates a new part in the backend using useCreatePart, making new parts visible in the inventory dashboard.
